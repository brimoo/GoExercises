# GoProjects

## About
Hello! This repo contains the code from my journey in learning the Go language. 

## How to Run
Make sure Go is installed first, then you can run the code in one of two ways. Firstly, you can clone this
repository into a Go workspace and name the directory src. Then each package can be installed by running
the following command: `go install /path/to/package/package_name`. The package can then be run with the
executable inside of the bin folder in the workspace. Alternatively, if you wish to build an individual
go file without setting up a workspace you can simply clone the repo anywhere and run the following 
command: `go run /path/to/file/file_name.go`. You can then run the generated executable.
